### Instructions

Use flexbox to recreate the following layouts (depicted in the layouts.pdf):

1. Simple Marketing 
2. Marketing with Nav
3. Magazine

Please Note: The three column layout that we completed in class has already been included as reference

Create a separate project folder for each layout

For example, when recreating the layout for the Simple Marketing layout, create a new folder called simple_marketing and add your index.html, and css files within that folder.
